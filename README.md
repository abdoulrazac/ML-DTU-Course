# DTU Course - Advanced Business Analytics / Advanced Data Science (2020)

Business Analytics (BA) is about exploring and analysing large amounts of data to gain insight into past business performance in order to guide future business planning. This course introduces a portfolio of advanced data-centric methods which cover the three main directions in BA: Descriptive (“what happened?”), predictive (“what will happen?”), and prescriptive (“what should happen?”). The methods will be applied to various business cases with the aim to demonstrate how to extract business value from data, provide data-driven decision support along with effective data management principles.
